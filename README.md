## The files containing .csv extension are the ones that contain databse structure and can be easily imported to the databases, Also you can clear the contents of the database but please don't remove the articles and do include 0 in the table which will contain article names
## for database table name use csv file name and import it respectively so that no changes need to be made in PHP files.
## loginPage.html is the first page for user end which allows them to login
## adminlogin is ready and is commented in every admin pages, once an admin login information is inserted in database it can be used to make admin login work and please uncomment from other admin pages to make it unaccessible through admin page.
## PHP code is self explanatory and i have commented it too.
## It is explandable to other fields by tweaking the databases accordingly.
## Once google cloud is set DO CHANGE the SQL Connection which contains database name, user name and more.
